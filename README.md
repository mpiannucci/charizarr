# charizarr

A small, opinionated, async zarr 3.0 implementation written in rust

This is beginning as a way to deep dive into zarr and to push whats possible
with rust and async.

## Development

This crate requires nightly rust to build until async/await is released to the stable channel.

```bash
rustup default nightly
```
